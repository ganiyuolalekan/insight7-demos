QUESTION: What  is the purpose of ARPA-H?
=========
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more.\
While we’re at it, let’s make sure every American can get the health care they need. \n\nWe’ve already made historic investments in health care. \n\nWe’ve made it easier for Americans to get the care they need, when they need it. \n\nWe’ve made it easier for Americans to get the treatments they need, when they need them. \n\nWe’ve made it easier for Americans to get the medications they need, when they need them.\
The V.A. is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping  veterans get the care they deserve. \n\nWe need to extend that same care to all Americans. \n\nThat’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass legislation that would establish a national registry of toxic exposures, and provide health care and financial assistance to those affected.

FINAL ANSWER: The purpose of ARPA-H is to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. (SOURCES: 1-32)
