User Testing Session with David Cameron Transcript

Speaker 0 00:00:06 All right. So set out to build, um, inside seven, like I had the idea for it like three years ago. Um, while I was working at a startup in Toronto before I joined Shopify. And I was working on a project and I just felt like we were, we didn't have clarity on what we were working on, kind problems. We're trying to solve the customers, the market. We were trying to go into a new market and expand the product into like a new market. So we felt the same software, SaaS product could work for new industries. And so I was leading that project, but at the end of the day, we were just accepting a project. We weren't building a product. Yeah. And I felt like we didn't have visibility into like customer needs, pain points, the market needs, challenges, all those things we were building for personas, users, all that data team field. Speaker 0 00:00:56 We had a good understanding of that. And so I felt like they needed to, and we using spreadsheets, you know, the usual stuff, slides. Yeah. So like there needed to be a two way, you have all that data in one place. And, and this was three years ago. And so I've been thinking about it and figuring out what's the best way to approach this problem and solve it. So the initial idea was, hey, can we get, aggregate all the data that companies need? B2B companies need to make decisions to, you know, build for their customers. But I felt like it would take years to get there, to be able to prove value and then charge customers, right? And so I started seeing some of these repository tools, you know, pop up like Dovetail and Coal. I was like, okay, there's actually something for an opportunity for just giving people teams, the box. Speaker 0 00:01:40 So they put their, their data in it, they make sense of it, and then over time you can put in fit in data for them. So that became the play for us. So right now we're just building out the box. Um, you put your data in it and, you know, make sense of it. But when we ship the first version of the product, we realized that just giving people the box wasn't enough. We had to provide 10 x the value to, to, to folks. And so they investing in like, okay, how do we accelerate the time to insight, start to break AI, um, features into the product so that we could, um, help you do it 10 times faster than you can do it today. So I'll show you like a quick demo of like come some of the call features here, what, what you can do with the app. So this is the homepage. You call me a shortcuts to setting things. You can transcribe video interviews, you can extract insights from those transcripts. Customized data can, saves from the web. So it's not just a customer data platform, it's also a market research product you can Speaker 2 00:02:41 Do. Do you mind if I give you my feedback? Like, do you mind, rather than doing the demo, I can give you feedback on what I think Speaker 0 00:02:48 Okay. Before dive. Sure, sure, sure. Let's do that. Then we can go into like Speaker 2 00:02:51 Yeah. Cause that way I like, I can, I can sort of imagine Speaker 0 00:02:55 Yeah. Yeah. That Speaker 2 00:02:56 As a, like a fresh, fresh user. Um, so like, I'm logged in, I'm in the dashboard. Um, okay. My general, my my general. Speaker 0 00:03:05 Are you logged in now or you want, do you wanna log in and show me? Or, Speaker 2 00:03:10 Um, like if, if you have an account that I could log into, I think that would be awesome cuz that way I could kind of like poke around and, and, and sort of like, imagine like what, what does this actually do? Speaker 0 00:03:20 Yeah, yeah. We could do that. Yeah, sure. So it's just go to app dot insight dot i Speaker 2 00:03:29 App Dots. Speaker 0 00:03:32 Its app dot inside seven dot I. Speaker 1 00:03:37 Okay. Speaker 2 00:03:41 I just continue with Google. Speaker 0 00:03:43 Yeah. Can you share a screen? Speaker 2 00:03:47 Yeah, I will. Sorry. Here. Okay. I'll put you over here. Interesting. Okay. So it's interesting because for whatever reason it's got like an extra like Speaker 0 00:04:08 Yeah. Can you, Speaker 2 00:04:09 I can make, I can make it bigger. Speaker 0 00:04:11 No, no. Yeah. Bigger. No. Uh, yeah. Speaker 2 00:04:19 Like I'm on a wide screen monitor and I'm using half my screen. Speaker 0 00:04:23 Right. Right. I think the, the resolution you have, yeah. I think that's the right resolution. This one or a bit bigger. Yeah. Speaker 2 00:04:29 Let me, let try Yeah. This is it. Okay. So we'll do it over there. Speaker 0 00:04:34 The responsiveness, but Yeah. Speaker 2 00:04:36 Right. I'll, I'll, um, let me, let me just, I would prefer to do it over here. Okay. That seems to be okay. Yeah, I listen to that. Okay. I'm gonna clear that cause I just don't like having bubbles. Um, alright, so I'm Insight seven home. Welcome. Now you can automate your customer market research and decide on the right things to build. Okay. So it seems like that's, I'm curious and like automate, automate your customer market research. I curious on like how that will happen. Um, and then I, I'm assuming that with here, it's gonna gimme some sort of like, insights. So, um, that started, looks like I can summarize data, I can extract insights, save web link, transcribe audio and video. Um, my, and then there there's some activity which I assume will be more interesting. If I'm working with a team, I can see what other people are doing. Speaker 2 00:05:34 Um, whereas if I'm the only person doing it, that might not be as, as useful. Yeah. To me, um, transcribe audio video for me that makes like, assuming that I'm doing kind of one of these calls, I might want to just upload the video afterwards and it'll just transcribe it and, and then I'm assuming that I'll have some ability to annotate that maybe, or pull it some, some interesting data. Save web link. I mean, I think it just saves the url. Save the url. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, I'm not sure exactly where, where that'll go afterwards. Probably my library. Um, transferring video or audio research clips. Yeah. Summarize research content or text in two clicks. Okay. So I have no idea what that's gonna do. Um, I'm assuming based off of our previous conversation that there's some sort of AI summary thing that'll happen here. Um, but I'm, I'm not sure what, what it means by two clicks. Speaker 2 00:06:33 Extract insights from customer interviews, interview notes and surveys. Again, I'm not sure like, is this an AI or am I extracting insights? Like is this a task for me or is this something automated? And if it's automated, why, why do I have to press the button to, to do that versus, um, it doing it for me. Uh, I'm also just because I, it bothers me. Um, I'm gonna point out some like layout issues. This is not the same size, not centered in the same way that this is. Yeah. Um, title case here, preferred versus, um, capital S and capital A. And then the icons here are all, um, inconsistent and the space and stuff like that. So I, I just had to cuz it it's, it's the, it's the kind of the details that Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That personally like really throw me off in terms of the quality of an overall product, even though it doesn't have anything materially to do with the actual product itself. Speaker 2 00:07:28 And then the other thing I'd say is like, um, this entire thing feels like a click target. And so I'm not sure whether like, this looks like one and this looks like one mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I actually don't wanna watch the tutorial. I want to like, um, and so it just, it feels a little bit weird to me. Um, maybe I'll go to the other screen cuz that, that doesn't seem to wanna render nicely. Um, okay. So I'm in the editor. Um, okay, so I'm interesting. So we got the home. Why? It's interesting, it's like I wasn't expecting it to collapse whenever I did that. Um, yeah. Speaker 0 00:08:06 So we did that intentionally. So you can have more space on the editor. Speaker 2 00:08:10 Um, yeah, I, I get like the why behind, but it also just felt like from a, like more of a jarring experience. Um, anyways, this isn't, this isn't necessarily the feedback that you're looking for in terms of like UX of the system, but maybe I'll try to figure out. So, um, transcribe audio or video I'd upload, you know, the whatever I have. Um, there's an editor, there's insights users and I'm assuming this is like a sample users start the research. We think about how to capture user stories. The hardest part of the research flow is synthesis, which is expensive and time consuming. Okay. Research report on customer research workflow. And I can delete this report. I'm assuming that this is just like a MD space situation. Yeah. Um, okay. So it's got some sample notes in here, which I guess is part of my library. Speaker 0 00:09:25 Yeah. Speaker 2 00:09:26 Um, and okay, so this is the con you highlight. To summarize these automatically saved alongside, there are links in your library. Okay. So that's like assuming that I have some documents. Speaker 0 00:09:38 Yep. Speaker 2 00:09:41 I have no idea what just happened. Oh, it just took a long time. Speaker 0 00:09:50 Um, that should not happen. That's strange. Yeah, there's something broken there. Speaker 2 00:09:56 That's okay. I'll, uh, I'll just like reload and summarize. Okay. So summarize content in three clicks. Let's see how to summarize your content automatically. Uh, click to open content summarizer, add title of your summary, piece of content you wanna summarize, click to summarize content. Okay. So I'm assuming this is just like AI stuff. So if I had like Speaker 0 00:10:22 Yeah. Speaker 2 00:10:23 Something I don't know, slides. Um, Speaker 0 00:10:47 So can you copy like, like an article if it's not really long you not really like, Speaker 2 00:10:53 So let me just go to like, I don't know. Speaker 0 00:10:55 Yeah, if you copy like for something. Speaker 2 00:11:00 I'm just gonna go to some actually. Why don't just do like a, uh, Speaker 1 00:11:07 Uh, Speaker 2 00:11:08 Aggregates. Nope, that's not it. Uh, that's not it either. Just need something. All right. I'll just do this. Uh, what is this? Uh, open B probably isn't gonna work super well. Cause this is like a tutorial for how to like run something. Yeah, yeah. This is not, like, this Speaker 0 00:11:53 Is not the Speaker 2 00:11:54 Typical, not, not like this is, uh, not a good thing. Okay. Um, then yeah, no, isn't working. But Speaker 0 00:12:03 That one's broken. I'm is looking into it now. Speaker 2 00:12:08 Um, and then the settings, you know, who I am, that sort of stuff. Okay. Why don't, I don't know if there's much I can do here in terms of like empty state. So I could probably let you share the screen and then continue on with your demo. Um, I, I think my overall, yeah, I'd love to, I'd love to see sort of like what Yeah, like maybe more of like how, how it actually, how it actually works. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, Speaker 0 00:12:35 How, how about you try the editor yourself? Click on edit. Yeah. I can send you like a text sample text. Sure. Um, yeah, how to send it to you. Speaker 2 00:12:49 Can you just post something assuming that it like in a chat if you wanted Speaker 0 00:12:53 Yeah, I'm trying to do that. But I think there's, there's a cap on how, and it's usually valuable when it's, well, let me send you something. Either way. Let me send something in the, so you can just assume this is like a transcript from cost interview. Um, Speaker 2 00:13:29 I save the note first, then I'm gonna analyze the note. Speaker 2 00:13:51 Okay. All right. So we're seeing kind of keyword analysis. So if I wanna tag the overall note, um, which may be interesting if I, um, I can kind of imagine that these things are like, um, like let's, let's assume I was the product management for taxes and we start talking about taxes in here. I might wanna like tag and say, hey, we're, we're talking about like approach. Um, okay. So I was, I was assuming that these were like a set of tags that I could potentially apply to this note rather than it being the keywords that were like summarized from. Maybe that's just like me as assuming that like, part of this is there's gonna be, um, a machine that does something for me. Mm. And then there's some human in the loop that is like, hey, actually, um, I don't want to tag or produce. Um, and also it looks like you're doing stemming here or something. I'm not sure why produce is, is sort of showing up. Oh, it's because, uh, I, if it was because of the cause of this, that's why. Yeah. Um, and I would say if I like analyze the note, um, or save the note, I guess the keywords are probably attached to, to saving the note. Speaker 0 00:15:05 Yeah. So you could, so one thing you could do, you could also highlight, so these are the insights, but you also, you could also highlight the exact thing the user said. So you could pick like the, so let's say you have to tag the, so if you click tag and then put a tag Yeah. So that inserts it. Sorry. You have to select the insights you want to map it to. So let's say you, she's talking about her workflow. In one of those insights you have to select that insight card, the insight card on the right. So select it, just click on it. Yeah. So you can reorder it. But when you select, you can then put the highlight on, like, you can map it to the highlight. Speaker 2 00:16:01 Yeah. I'm not sure what uh, Speaker 0 00:16:03 So click on the click on what the highlight you created already. Yeah. On highlight it. On highlight, yeah. You've already selected the inside card. So do a search for workflow to see where she said that. Speaker 2 00:16:17 Okay. Speaker 0 00:16:18 Do search for workflow in the transcript. Yeah. Yeah. So you see where she said it, right? Where she said the workflow. So highlight that phrase where she said it. Yeah. Like yeah. Can highlight, highlight and then put a tag, click on it again, and then put a tag there. Um, did it work? Speaker 2 00:16:47 It doesn't look like it. Or like, I don't see taxes down here. Like I, I created a tag called taxes. Speaker 0 00:16:53 If you go, if you go down, you see a tag on the other side. Cuz that's where, so scroll down on the right side. Yeah. So it's, I dunno why the highlight isn't showing up. It should, Speaker 2 00:17:02 Oh, and it also, uh, doesn't de-duplicate my tags. It adds those as a uh, Speaker 0 00:17:07 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Speaker 2 00:17:10 It just adds those as like, okay. Um, Speaker 0 00:17:15 And then you can publish this a so is the, and all the highlights. So Speaker 1 00:17:26 <affirmative>, Speaker 0 00:17:42 So we're working on the formatting of this. So you'll be able to see the insight, you'll be able to see the highlights, you'll be able to see the tabs, everything generated in one click. And they can download it as PDF for PowerPoints if you wanna like create slides. Speaker 2 00:18:03 Oh, Speaker 0 00:18:03 Okay. So now if you go to the report section Speaker 2 00:18:14 Yeah. For some reason I can't, like, it seems like when I, I guess Speaker 0 00:18:22 You want to try that again. Speaker 2 00:18:24 Well, no, I was just like, I was, sorry. What I, what I was expecting was that this would be like, like I don't know how to get to a new note, right? Like, let's say I'm doing like customer, customer interview two, customer interview three, like there's a, uh, and then I'm assuming it's probably the notes or Speaker 0 00:18:41 Something like that. No, I, I didn't get that. It would be like what? Speaker 2 00:18:45 Um, so the, the issue is, is like I, like I consider my workflow done. I did customer a interview already, um, and I wanted to go back and like create a new note. Speaker 0 00:18:57 Right. Right, Speaker 2 00:18:58 Right. Like I can't do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because it seems like the, because this is the, the challenge that I ran into here is that I came to the editor and it was blank. And so my workflow started from a oh go to the magic editor cuz that's where you paste things in. Like, and in my head that was like my starting point Yeah. For it rather than it being like, this is the thing that you were actively working on and going and jumping between ones like saving state. Like I appreciate that it saves state, but I'm also like, I, I guess I don't know why magic editors suffer from notes and I haven't been able to look at notes, but why are like, and maybe I'm just like trained by Shopify, but it's like notes are the thing and then I have to create off of that. Speaker 2 00:19:42 Yeah. And so like, I like one thing that, um, also like here, uh, maybe let me, let me just think for for a moment in terms of some of my, like my overall feedback here. Um, I think over time what I don't get from this dashboard is like activity is actually not the thing that I care about. Like the overall insights Yeah. Is probably the thing that I care most about whenever I first launch into this. Like imagine that I am a, I am like the, the product lead for a group of people and I want to get, I wanna be able to come here and be like, Hey, what is the overall thing Speaker 0 00:20:26 Yeah. Speaker 2 00:20:27 That, that is happening. Or maybe I just had a conversation and I wanted to, I wanna capture that just, just because I like wanted to be in the system. And so how do like, you know, those sort of two jobs are, are kind of like what I'm imagining are the, the initial jobs. Yeah. I would probably just really simplify Yeah. To like add content. Cause like there's lots of options which makes it look like there's lots of things you can do. Yeah. Yeah. But also I, I think you should just really focus on like one or two jobs and do it really, really well would be my initial feedback. Like people need to be able to trust that the data they put in here, um, is always available to them. Because like when you invest in any tool, it's always a fear of like, how can I pull that data out? Speaker 2 00:21:17 And so before I would do anything, um, around this tool, I would want to make sure that, that I'm not locked in. Yeah. Um, and I can take backups because like, this is really critical business information, um, for me. And then the other piece would be, I don't know what notes looks like, but imagine I already have a bunch of docs or I have a bunch of like cool docs that I had customer insights Yeah. In and this is likely not the tool that I'm starting from scratch with. Yeah. Yeah. So how do I get, how do I get some of like the, the folder on my desktop or my Google Drive folder of research that I've collected over the last six months? Yeah. How do I easily drag it and drop it, um, and, and get it into this tool? And then how do you automatically do work for me that like, makes that magical so that like I put stuff in here and you're like, Hey, look across all of these documents, I'm noticing some patterns. Speaker 2 00:22:15 Did you notice these patterns? And, and like really give me that mind map ability to say, oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize that people keep talking about, uh, tax holidays for whatever reason. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and then, or, or even similarity. But you could start like simple, gimme something and you immediately get value out of doing that. Where it's like, obviously I wanna just like put data into this system because more data I put into this, the more magic I get out of it. Uh, I think is really, really what, um, you wanna get out of it. And I, I would probably like, Speaker 2 00:23:00 Like, I guess questions for me is like I would probably simplify this entire left hand side to be like, I don't know what library is versus notes. I also don't know the value of actually saving a web link. Like I rarely ever do that. Um, that could just be me. And, but, uh, I, I guess the question I have right now is what is this product? And I was assuming this product was more on the, here's the, the customer research audio video, um, and docs and here like audio video to transcribe to docs, which have like Gong is really great in that it does a lot of this and so, but gong is also really expensive. Um, and so I would, I would probably, if, if I were you, um, really kind of focus on docs audio and video, how do we get that information in here? Speaker 2 00:23:59 How do we extract that? And then once we get like, get people to add more content, how do we build AI on top of that that just like magically happens as you do that? Um, and really just try to make that, that better. And then insights and reports. Like part of this, I'm assuming is like stuff that you generate and then part of this is like what the, the product manager or or user researcher, whoever is doing this is kind of building. Yeah. Um, if it's a product manager, I don't know where, and, and maybe that's my insights pieces. What, like, I always, I always like take all of the pieces and start categorizing the accounting. Yeah. And like, I don't know where categorizing and accounting fits in around like how does this map to, um, the gaps or needs, uh, in the roadmap. Speaker 0 00:24:57 Hm. Speaker 2 00:25:00 And, and I real like what I like from an onboarding perspective, I think it would be need like how you, how you can show that immediate value, um, that gets someone to invest time in uploading a hundred docs. Speaker 0 00:25:25 Absolutely. Speaker 2 00:25:27 Yeah. Like what, what's the magic sauce? Is the, the question that I would be Speaker 0 00:25:31 Yeah. I feel like, yeah, so imagine we had that we, we, we already have that like sample content that you can just click and analyze and see the magic Right. Um, within the editor, for example. Um, so maybe put in giving you the ability to do that. Although I also feel like it helps when the user has that blank space to try out something on their own. Um, but maybe it helps to just as part of the onboarding, give you like that sample content you can analyze yourself and then see the magic. Speaker 2 00:26:06 Yeah. And or maybe it's like this, this, this default homepage. Like it's, it's really Yeah, I would probably just rework the homepage to, if I were completely honest. Um, a recent activity is only valuable in my opinion whenever you have many people. And so I'm assuming that it's gonna be small teams or one person that like the, the onboarding which case recent activity I think doesn't serve any value. Um, and then I would really focus focusing on, Speaker 2 00:26:43 Or maybe it's like most recent note or most recent insights or I, I, I'm not, I'm not sure what the right homepage is, but like if I come back here, like, why am I here? Yeah. Um, I'm assuming that I'm either the person that's putting data in, in which case I would just streamline the like add, add feedback somewhere. Like, just like add content should be like, but, but right now there's four choices and I'm not sure what, why, why would I choose one versus the other? But like, what you really wanna do is like, you wanna add content, great. Add content. Okay. Then it's like, what content are you adding? Are you like uploading something? Or in fact I would just like maybe take something from, you know, I guess the question is, and maybe the question I would ask people is like, where do you store your content today? Speaker 2 00:27:38 Um, like does it make sense to do drag and drop cause you have it on your computer? Or does it make sense to do, um, office 365 integration and Google Drive integration and link to those things and, and make this more seamless, but really kind of focusing on optimizing that, that like, how do I get data in? And then from there, um, when I come back, like, is Insight seven doing something for me in the background where when I come back here there's something fresh, something new, um, and I don't know if that's like your AI algorithms are getting better, um, or you're adding new features. Um, Speaker 2 00:28:24 Or, um, because people on my team are adding more data in here, like I can come here to see like more interesting, um, examples and I can, I can like dive into these things. Like what I would love to do is, hey, um, we're about to start on something to do with taxes. Okay, now I want to go and, and like find the thing that like, summarize all of that and I want to go and then watch and read a bunch of that content. And so like, how do I start from that tag or like thing that I'm about to do and then go, what I really wanna understand is like the before and after in context around that, that that particular thing and be able to listen to it or watch the video. And that's again, one of the nice things about Gong is you can search for something and then you, you, you will like click on it and you will go directly to where that is in the video and audio conversation. And then you can go, oh, and you can read around it cuz you have a transcript synced with the audio video. Um, and then you can go through it. I have, sorry, I have another thing that I need to, to run to. I booked a meeting with someone and then I Yeah, no worries. But um, Speaker 0 00:29:34 Yeah, I think this is, this, this was really good, super useful. Um,


Refunds Workflow User Testing session transcript

Yeah, just some, some context, Um, very quickly as we start, um, so within the RO adjustment space, we, we've learned from customers that there are different reasons why, you know, they would like to adjust an RO. Um, so we've had things like refunds for things like changing metadata on an RO, you know, different reasons. Um, and what we know, you know, is that those changes have an impact on accounting in most cases. And, um, there's a way customers would like that to reflect in terms of accounting and reporting. And so we're trying to design, um, an experience that would make it easy for, you know, customers to make those adjustments, um, without disrupting, you know, accounting, financial

Sorry. Okay, great. Um, yeah. So the way we're trying to solve this is started from the reforms workflow. We're trying to build out the right data models at the foundations to make sure that, you know, customers are able to apply for a refund, which is kind of an adjustment to an RO. Um, and it flows, you know, in the right manner, into reporting, into accounting, and all those, um, downstream has the right downstream implications. Um, it's essentially where we are. And then going forward we'll start to build up more of those RO adjustment capabilities like metadata editing, things like that. Um, does that sound good for context? 

Perfect. All right. So let's dive in, um, on, onto like RO adjustments and refunds. Um, so when it comes to read ones, um, I'll just ask a few questions and then go straight into the US prototypes to get feedback. Um, what would you say are some of the, you know, most common reasons why you would want do a, um, to your customer common use cases for, 

Um, so, you know, most common reasons, um, would be, you know, work, work that was, that was built for but not performed, right. Um, a customer satisfaction refund, right? For, for, you know, for whatever the issue might be. Um, sometimes it's a warranty issue, right? Where, where, where, you know, the customer was forced to get a warranty repair done at another shop and pay for it, and we're gonna, you know, we're gonna give the money back on a warranty type of thing. Um, a late coupon, again, that kind of falls into customer satisfaction, right? Yeah. Well, what else guys? What am I missing? No, that's pretty much 

It. I mean, I had one yesterday where it was that exact case. The customer went somewhere else and they defected out a part that we put on. They charged the customer and they came back here and I just had to write him a check, whatever. But then you gotta go in and refund it and everything, and it's kind of, that's a headache. 

Okay. That's, Thank you for, for sharing that. Um, do you ever have to do part return as, as part of the process of, Okay. Um, and what, what kind of scenarios do you get to do part? Can you describe very briefly how that works? Well, we'd have to, we'd make a new invoice, um, with, it would have the return part on it, you know, then it obviously would have the refund back to the customer. So it makes the accounting, it makes the books accurate. And then as far as returning the, the part to get our refund on the part, if you have a paper trail for it. Right? So let's say we in inadvertently, you know, we ordered a part for a customer's car, right? Um, then at, you know, at some point we were actually not gonna install that part, but we inadvertently charged that customer as though we did. Um, so, you know, we would have to then a, refund the customer and b, return that part. Right. 

And, um, is that what, what, what would you say is broken in that current workflow that you have using Tech Metric? Could you About doing that return and refund in Tech Metric today? Well, well currently, obviously right now we, for that type of return, we have to get in touch with support to un post the invoice, Right? All of that, um, go through that, you know, in your system it is kind of, it's, it's not, it's not horrible. It's a multi-step process, right? Um, I think in our mining key legacy system, one, one of the, not that it was a great, great system, otherwise we wouldn't be here with you guys, right? But, but one of the nice things about it was, okay, I'm gonna, you know, a we're gonna do, it's just a brand new invoice, right? So from an, and I think, I know we've talked about this before, but from a, from an accounting standpoint, um, it's a refund. It's a refund. Ignore. It's in, it's in, it's in, it's in, you know, it's, it's a separate transaction, right? And then we would have, we would have, you know, an options, right? We'd have questions, Do you want to, do you wanna take the time away? You know, the, the flat rate time away from the tech for this refund, right? Yes or no? Um, do you wanna return the part yes or no? Things like that, right? Cause there's different scenarios and, and that that could be true in all of those. So, so you kind of need those options. 

And then the other part of it too, Greg, is, you gotta think that, you know, we already paid out royalties, um, to, I mean, corporate, that somehow that's gotta be refunded as well, Right? So again, if it's a separate negative, and so with our old system when it was a separate negative transaction, it, it kind of gave those royalties back, right? Right. Our royalties were based on gross, gross sales for the week, right? So if on on Monday I write a refund for a hundred dollars, that's gonna come off of my gross sales for the week. And that's how I get those, that's how I get those, those, right, Right. Those royalties don't necessarily have to be tied to an invoice. They're always tied to a sales category. So what did I do in this category this week? And, and it's gonna be less than, less than, and, and, and we'll pay less royalties, right? So, but that, those have to match up accurately. Got it. Um, and, and today, what, what would you say is the work around for this? Like how do you, how do you navigate this in, I think what I hear you say is like, there's, you can do it in Teme, but it's like a multi-step process. You have to reach out to support on post and before you get this done, right? Yeah. Yeah. We had, I mean, I, my, my business partner, Mark had to do one a couple of weeks ago and, and it, you know, it was like a, it was like a 20 step deal, right? it was, it was ridiculous to get this thing done. And again, we've got managers and shops, there's us, us hoping that they're gonna do this correctly every time, especially when it's so cumbersome. They're gonna just blow by it. They're gonna find they're gonna, they're gonna find a work around, right? Which is not gonna be anybody's benefit, um, but theirs, so workarounds are bad. Yeah. And I think it also, um, like in addition to being a workaround, uh, currently if you try to return part, it reduces the sales on the original invoice, which would mess up your books for if like that accounting period was closed, Right? It's absolutely useful feedback. Uh, final question before I jump into the prototypes, Uh, which of the reports would you say it's, it's really quick to have that reforms data flow into? Could you, could you re-ask that question? Um, so in terms of reports, where, where would you like that refunds information? So you provided refund, um, someone provides the refunds at the shop. Where would you like to see that refund data? Speaker 2 00:08:31 Oh, on, on, on the end of day report, right? So we have our, so again, you know, we have our, our sales, our refunds, right? So sales minus refunds equals your net revenue for the day. Speaker 0 00:08:43 Yeah. Speaker 2 00:08:47 And then everything is off of that net revenue number, right? That's, that's, you know, that's where we start to calculate royalties, all all of that stuff, right? Speaker 0 00:08:57 Okay. Any other report? Speaker 2 00:09:02 Well, I mean, in a, in an ideal world, right? You would just be able to drill down from that end of day report, you'd be able to click on that number and it would open, you know, it would show you, okay, you had four refund invoices today, They were, you know, B, C, D, and E, right? And yeah, the ability to drill down off that initial report would make it beautiful. Speaker 0 00:09:22 Okay. Speaker 2 00:09:24 There could be a refund detail report if, if that's not possible, but a practical component. Speaker 6 00:09:30 Okay. And regarding the, the end of day report, um, so we have like a lot of aggregate revenue numbers, like total sales. Um, ideally, would you like that, like the revenue, that revenue number already to be net of refunds? Or would you prefer like being able to show with refunds and without, So you can see like what portion is refund versus, um, you Speaker 2 00:09:59 Know, I, I think this is, I think this is where we've had a disconnect with you guys from right, from the get go, right? Um, so in, in our, in our world and in our minds, if I do a hundred dollars in sales and I write a $20 refund mm-hmm. <affirmative> on a day, I did $80 in sales. Yeah. Speaker 6 00:10:19 Right? Speaker 2 00:10:19 Yeah. You guys, your system says, no, you did a hundred dollars in sales, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, if I did a hundred in sales and gave a $10 discount, that's a $90 in sales. You guys look at it as, no, you did a hundred dollars in sales, right? So I think it's super important that, that, you know, so if we, if we separate sales and revenue, revenue is really, what is the, is the number that's from an accounting standpoint is very important to us, right? Um, so sales minus refunds, right? Is now with US sales was already after discounts, right? And your world, maybe we have to do sales minus discounts minus refunds to get to net revenue. Does that make sense? Mike and Paul, Speaker 7 00:11:03 Can you hear me? Speaker 2 00:11:05 Yep. Speaker 7 00:11:06 Yep. Oh, you can hear me now? Okay. Yeah. It, you was hitting the nad on the head that Tech Metrics thinks that, um, discounts are income, They are not income. You never get discounts as income. If it was, I would pay my staff with discounts and then she very, very happy. So, and what I'm telling you now told Sunil, I'm, I'm pretty blunt in what I say, and Greg and Mike will bear me out on that. To put discounts in there is just a load of junk. And I think that's why you're struggling in some of your refunds because your invoices keep calculating discounts and allocating discounts. Discounts is, is an advertising marketing function. It's not an accounting function. And there's a tax implication as well. If you start showing the, the, the, the sales tax people that you're doing discount, they want us to pay the sales tax on the discount, right? Speaker 7 00:12:02 Well, why do I want to pay sales tax on a discount when it would be a normally a hundred dollars bill? We're giving, we are only charging the customer $80 and now the sales tax people want their sales tax on the $20 discount. So you guys are putting us in a very dangerous position. We're also in a situation where we pay franchise fees, and I can, I won't tell you the names, but I know franchisees that have been asked to pay the discount that the franchise fees on the discounts by the mine auditors, Fortunately they fired the mine auditors. So they're not there anymore. But you guys open up a whole, whole, um, can of worms for us with this discount. And I say, I think that's what clogs up your refunds. Cuz every time they try and calculate it, they've gotta bring the refunds into it. Refund should just be a memor random amount, and that's it. Which is what, it's in a name key and it works very well. Mm-hmm. Speaker 6 00:13:01 <affirmative>. Okay. I think that might be a function of how the mine key implemented the royalty report. Um, as far as discounts go in on invoices or on the end of day. Speaker 7 00:13:14 Um, Sorry Amy, I'm gonna, I'm gonna interrupt you there. Mikey don't want it. I know that as a fact, they never asked for discounts. They couldn't believe it when they showed, when they, when we told them about it. Speaker 6 00:13:25 Y yeah. And it might be something with like the implementation where discounts got calculated incorrectly. Um, I guess, I guess as far as like the end of day report goes, um, we do show sales after discounts and that's what you're looking for, correct? The No, Speaker 7 00:13:44 We, we don't, we don't want discounts in there at all. It's not an accounting function, Speaker 2 00:13:50 Right? So, so I think, so again, I I think, I think it's just, we look at it differently, right? Sales after discounts is sales period for us. Does that make sense? If I have a product that, that, that retail that has a, that has a price tag on it of a hundred dollars mm-hmm. <affirmative>, right? Gimme a coupon for $10. I sold it for $90, that's my sale, right? Speaker 6 00:14:13 Yeah. Yes. And that should be how it works. Speaker 7 00:14:18 No, it doesn't. It doesn't, it starts off by giving us the total figure, including the discounts. That's not how you account for it. In other words, in the tech metrics, the top line, the very top line has got discounts in it. Speaker 6 00:14:34 Mm. Okay. Speaker 7 00:14:35 It's an unheard of accounting. Unfortunately, I started off life as an accountant, but as a salesman, then I became an accountant. So I'm a paint, I'm a thorn in everybody's flesh. Again, Greg and Mike can tell you that Speaker 6 00:14:47 <laugh>. Okay. I'll need to look into a little bit more, but, and so are in, within tech metric, are you referring to like the reporting, the reports, like the end of day report? It's not showing the sales correctly? Speaker 7 00:15:03 No. The, in the end, the bottom line is correct, Amy mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but the top line is incorrect. It's like saying, it's like saying to you, Okay, Amy, I'll tell you what we gonna do. We're gonna charge, we're gonna pay you a thousand dollars a month, okay? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but we're gonna take off $20 and give it to a charity. Speaker 6 00:15:22 Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Speaker 7 00:15:23 A charity you don't want, it's called discount. That's not income to you. Okay? Right. You want your thousand dollars, don't you? Speaker 6 00:15:33 Correct. Speaker 7 00:15:35 Okay. So our, our gross revenue is the, the, the, the amount, the, the, the, the discount means nothing. Okay. So a marketing toy to get people in, that's all it is. Speaker 6 00:15:48 Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Speaker 7 00:15:49 No different than everybody else. When you go, when they go, when you go there, they don't, you know, you go and buy a product, you want the discount on it, don't you? You don't wanna be charged sales tax on the discount, do you? Speaker 6 00:16:01 Right. And I, I Speaker 2 00:16:03 It's like, it's like that 60% off that sweater, right? It's kind of the same thing. We all know, we all know nobody ever paid 60% over that price. Right? Right. Speaker 6 00:16:13 Yeah. And I think, I think maybe where there's some misalignment is how I understand it works in tech metric is you don't ch you don't get, we don't charge sales tax on discounts. So like the, and maybe this is what you're talking about when you say the bottom line number is correct. That's the one I'm thinking of where like, if labor tax, let's say is 10% and you charge a hundred dollars on labor and you have a $50 coupon, then the labor tax is $5, not $10. Right? Speaker 2 00:16:46 Right, right. Is Speaker 6 00:16:47 How, and it works in tech metric, and I think maybe that's where my confusion is. Um, Speaker 7 00:16:53 But why do you, why do you, why do you, why do you say the total value of the invoice is a hundred dollars? Speaker 6 00:17:00 It should be Speaker 7 00:17:01 When all we do is surely, surely the total value of the, of the invoice is the value that we collect. Speaker 6 00:17:09 Right? And that's how I understand that it works. Speaker 7 00:17:11 But Tech Metric doesn't say that Tech Metrics is your total value. You start off with includes the discount. Okay. That's the value of the invoice. It's not Speaker 2 00:17:20 Can, are one of you guys able to put a put put an end date, end date report up on the screen? Mm-hmm. Speaker 6 00:17:25 <affirmative>? Yeah, I can share my screen. Speaker 0 00:17:30 All right. Just want to be mindful of time. I think once, um, yeah, Speaker 6 00:17:35 Actually we, we can go over the reef ones first since we only Speaker 0 00:17:39 Over the UX for the ones, and then yeah, if we have some time we can come back. Um, perfect. Let me just share my screen. Speaker 7 00:17:49 But, but in fact, you were asking for, for illustrations of when you might have discount that is, sorry, uh, refunds. That might be one where we forgot to put the discount on and we have to go back in there and add the discount in. Speaker 2 00:18:04 Well, another thing we need to be mindful of is, again, so let's say it was a, you know, let's say it was a hundred dollars break job and we gave a $20 discount. When we go to refund that job, we obviously don't wanna refund a hundred dollars, right? We wanna refund $80. So we have to make sure that calculates correctly. Speaker 0 00:18:23 All right? Um, alright, so for the refunds flow, I'm just gonna walk you through a few screens and, uh, feel free to, you know, share feedback as we go, just because we check in notes. The goal here is to really understand if, if the experience we have designed works for your current workflow and if it checks away all the, um, friction that you currently face. Um, and so we have, um, integrated this, we build out a refunds creation entry point into the, the, um, payments, um, our payment section of, of tech metric. So you can see here the, the changes we have added on this screen here is, you know, your ability to, there's a new bot in here where you can, you know, click on refund, and then you also have, you know, the invoice history where you can track all the transactions, um, related to, um, that, that you have made on that RO. Speaker 0 00:19:18 So if you click here on refund, you see here, the new thing that we're creating is the ability to, um, make an, um, you know, refund the customer's payment without adjusting the existing balance. Um, if you go the other option, this is what you currently have in tech metric today where you can refund the customer payment by adjusting the ex existing balance. Typically you want to do that on an hour that's open. Um, and so for an hour that has been posted, you want to go this route of, um, applying your refund to that RO and without, you know, adjusting the, the balance on the RO. Speaker 2 00:19:57 Um, so one, one thing just on that right there, one thing I might, I might suggest is if we could dumb that language down and it's in the descriptions, Speaker 0 00:20:06 Okay? Okay. Yes. Is it like, it's a lot of text or you don't understand Speaker 2 00:20:10 And you know, again, it, Right, let's pretend all of our managers are four year old, right? Um, you know, they're gonna go, okay, balance. What's, what am I doing? Is this about, you know, balance adjustment isn't, isn't a, isn't a term in their vocabulary in their day to day, right? Yeah. Um, so, you know, if just have, you know, again, maybe, maybe, maybe a question leads to, leads to it, right? Has this, has this RO been posted? Yes. Okay, then it's gonna take them right to where they should go. <crosstalk>, is it your choice? <crosstalk>? Is it yours, Right? Speaker 7 00:20:46 Yeah. Greg is is it, well, just, just, um, just clarify for me, uh, on that first one there, where it's got no, without, sorry, new without balance adjustment. Are you saying that they are, they're not actually giving a refund, they're just, uh, change in the allocation of the, of the invoice? Speaker 2 00:21:06 So we're, we're reopening this invoice, right? So this, we cash, let's say we cashed this out yesterday for $500. We're now reopening this and we're giving a hundred dollars, I'm assuming this is what I'm reading, right? And we're giving a hundred dollars back. So we're gonna change the balance of this invoice to 400. Am I correct? Yeah. Speaker 0 00:21:23 So the one on the, on the right hand, the right, um, box is what you currently have today. What we are introducing is the ability to provide that refund without changing the, the RO, um, balance. Speaker 7 00:21:38 Okay. So when would that happen? I'm lost on that. Speaker 2 00:21:41 Yeah, I'm confused on that. Speaker 0 00:21:42 You say when, Speaker 7 00:21:43 Yeah, I mean, you are either gonna give them some of the money back or order the money. So what we have in mke is, is this a full refund? Is that what you're Speaker 0 00:21:51 Saying? Yeah. So the next screen answers that. So here you can then select, oh, do you wanna refund the entire job or do you wanna refund like a part specific part Speaker 7 00:22:01 Of the job? So that's what it needs to say. Do you wanna make a full refund or do you wanna make a partial refund? Speaker 0 00:22:09 Okay. Speaker 7 00:22:10 Would you agree, Greg with that? Mark? Yeah. Speaker 2 00:22:12 Yeah. Again, I think that, that, that simplifies the language. That's, it's much more understandable. Speaker 7 00:22:17 I mean, it's full of partial, doesn't it? Speaker 2 00:22:19 Yep. Speaker 0 00:22:20 Yeah, it's full of partial. Yeah. So you can refund the entire thing. So here you just have like the 500 automatically show up for this, um, RO, or you can refund say labor entry, um, on the, on the RO. And you can also, um, edit the, also specify the amount. So let's say you want to provide a hundred percent of the refund, or you wanna specify, or I just want to give, you know, 20%. You can also specify that, um, on the, on the, on this model, Speaker 7 00:22:59 Can you, can you do a specific amount there? If you just want give $20 back or $5, how do you Speaker 0 00:23:04 Do that? Yes, exactly. You can just put the $20 here. Speaker 7 00:23:07 So it's Speaker 0 00:23:09 Do like a percentage before. Speaker 7 00:23:10 Yeah. Thank you. Speaker 0 00:23:13 All right. Um, and then once you, once you do that, um, and then that reflects the trying to move forward here. Speaker 0 00:23:24 Yeah. Once you do that, so assuming you wanted, wanted to refund the entire amount, um, the total refund is captured here, 500. Um, it shows up here as a new transaction. And then you also have the invoice history here. Uh, puring you like more details. So this is your original RO and then this is the refund, um, on top of that and gives you like that history of what has happened. Um, and then you can also come here if you want to view the invoice for that refund, you'll be able to do that easily from there. Speaker 4 00:24:01 So now when you go to the, and then report and look at it, where is it gonna show it? Where will it show it? The end of day report. Speaker 2 00:24:09 So refunds do show on the end of day report. They, they do now in the, in the RO summary, I think right on the left, um, Speaker 6 00:24:18 Yeah. Refund payments show like in the payments sec or they're included as part of the payments. Um, but right now, if you try and do a refund, it, it adjusts the original estimate. So if the accounting period is closed on that original estimate, it like goes back in history and changes it. Whereas difference with this new workflow is you can post that negative revenue to a different day than the original estimate. Okay. So, uh, it gets accounted for in the current accounting period and doesn't modify the previous one. Speaker 2 00:24:55 Perfect. That's, that's exactly what we need. Speaker 0 00:24:58 Yeah. So, so regarding reports you can see here, um, it shows up here, let me just fit this to screen. Um, you can see here the, the entry here, it's gonna have the same RO number, but it's gonna show up here as, you know, a negative entry that Yeah, you, you refunded this customer this amount on this dates also gonna capture a new date. Um, that's how it's gonna show up on the, on the payments report. Speaker 7 00:25:27 Can you show it on the end of a report, please? Amma? Speaker 0 00:25:31 Um, let me see. Speaker 2 00:25:40 Yeah, so on the left hand under RO summary, Speaker 0 00:25:43 Yeah, so you can see it here as an entry on the, on the RO summary, um, box as well. Speaker 7 00:25:54 Good, thanks. Speaker 2 00:25:57 Now that falls down to cashier as well, right? Speaker 6 00:26:02 Yeah, it, it'll go under the payment section, uh, for the actual like payment taken from the customer. So like if you refunded that $300 to somebody's credit card, that will show up under like credit card in the payment section. Speaker 2 00:26:19 Cause that's another challenge we're having, right? Is, is there's no, there's really no cash draw reconciliation, right? So at the end of the day, our, our, our store manager needs to know, okay, I have $300 in, in credit cards that I took in today. I have $200 in cash and I have a hundred dollars in checks. That's what I need to turn in, right? Speaker 6 00:26:41 Mm-hmm. Speaker 2 00:26:42 <affirmative>, um, that's, that's a bit of a, that's a bit of a juggling act right now. Right? Speaker 6 00:26:47 Got it. Okay. Yeah, I think you can find most of that information in payment details, but um, Speaker 2 00:26:54 That's not a friendly report though. That's okay. Again, four year, four year olds, right? Let's just give 'em a how much, how much, what am I, what am I supposed to put in my deposit envelope at the end of my shift? Right? Speaker 6 00:27:06 Got Speaker 2 00:27:07 It. Okay. This is how convenience stores get 17 year old kids to, to, to handle cash reliably. Right? <laugh>? Yeah. Speaker 6 00:27:15 Okay. So they wanna see it in like how it's shown on end of day, but okay. Speaker 7 00:27:22 Yeah, I agree with Greg and I think some of the thing is that the, the information's there, but it's all over the place. When a guy's cashing out a store, he wants to see everything in one place. Speaker 2 00:27:33 Yep. Make it easy. He knows exactly what to put in his drop envelope. That envelope goes into the safe. Right? And, and, and we know it's, you know, we, we can be fairly as short, it's correct. Right. Speaker 7 00:27:43 Yeah. Just going back to that, um, one where you showed us the actual refund, did it, I don't remember seeing anything on that screen there, Omo of how the refund was done? Yeah. So where we showed the actual refund here? Yeah. When, when you showed us those two screens, you want partial or do you want um, yeah, Speaker 2 00:28:04 Yeah. Oh yeah, I saw it. You could choose a payment method. Speaker 7 00:28:07 Okay, that's fine. I missed that. That's what Speaker 2 00:28:09 You cash or whatever. Yeah, I, yeah, there we Speaker 7 00:28:13 Go. Drop down. Yep. Right, Thanks. Yep. Speaker 2 00:28:16 And is this, and is this, this is, is this gonna integrate with tech merchant as well? So if it's a credit credit card refund, it'll process through Tech merchant just just like it does, Okay. Mm-hmm. Speaker 6 00:28:25 <affirmative>, Speaker 4 00:28:25 Will that credit card have to be present to do the refund or is it going to use it from the number that it captured previously? Speaker 6 00:28:35 Um, that's a good question. Cause right now Speaker 2 00:28:37 It's probably, it's probably gotta be present would be my guess for PCI compliance, right? All the only thing that gets stored is the truncated. That, that would be my guess anyway. Speaker 6 00:28:50 Yeah. So, so we actually don't store anything, but I think, um, Speaker 2 00:28:54 No, no, the processor though, even the credit card processor, right? They're just gonna, the only thing that you can see is, is the last four digits, right? The truncated version and that's all PCI compliance. So my guess would be that it's probably gonna have to be present. Speaker 6 00:29:09 Yeah. And I, well, I think you might be able to do the card not present refund too. Um, so like when we pull in that infor, like what you see in tech metric for card not present when you enter in your credit card information, um, it's actually pulling, uh, from 360. So we're in PCI compliance cuz we're not managing that, that piece of information on the form. Um, but Speaker 2 00:29:35 I, what I'm saying for, for 360 s PCI conform, it's may, it's probably a question for them, but Speaker 6 00:29:41 Yeah, that's a good question. Let me write it down how we're gonna handle the card number. Speaker 0 00:29:51 All right. Fantastic. Um, is there any other, are there other questions? Feedback? Speaker 7 00:29:58 Yeah. Famous question. How many years before this is done, Speaker 0 00:30:02 <laugh>? We're currently wrapping up exploration, new exploration, and we're looking to start to build this out to the next two weeks. So yeah, if, if, if you're telling us that this, this looks great for you, then the earlier we're gonna start building, Speaker 7 00:30:20 You're gonna start building in two weeks or be ready for us in two weeks. Speaker 0 00:30:24 No, no. Stop building in two weeks. Speaker 7 00:30:26 Uh, so you start building in two weeks and then we expect it in three years. Speaker 2 00:30:31 <laugh> Speaker 6 00:30:34 Hopefully not that long. Speaker 2 00:30:35 We're coming from legacy. That was the normal timeframe. That's why we're Speaker 7 00:30:40 I'll. Speaker 2 00:30:40 And angry <laugh>, Speaker 6 00:30:42 I impress that. Speaker 7 00:30:44 I'll tell you what, you guys take the Matrix need to buy a watch, not a calendar Speaker 2 00:30:48 <laugh>. So, so on average, what, what would be the, what's, let's say we started today, right? What, what, what roughly could we expect for a deliverable time? <affirmative>. Speaker 6 00:31:04 Oh Speaker 2 00:31:04 Geez, not quarters. Give give, give us a round, you know, a range of weeks and four to six, eight to 10. Speaker 6 00:31:14 I mean, Speaker 7 00:31:15 You're gonna have to go higher. Greg <laugh> Speaker 6 00:31:19 On the scope of work, but I think Speaker 7 00:31:23 I'll do you what I tell you. What if we fix cars, like you fix tech when you, Speaker 2 00:31:28 Tomorrow we'd outta Speaker 7 00:31:29 Business. Turn, say, Okay, Amy, uh, when do you want it back? Yeah, Speaker 2 00:31:34 You'd be throwing rocks at us. Speaker 7 00:31:36 I'll just a date any, Yeah. Yeah. You'd get your car back in about three years time. Speaker 6 00:31:45 <laugh>. Yeah. I mean, if we could get it done by, I don't know. I it's hard to put numbers on it without talking to all the engineers. <laugh>. Speaker 2 00:31:57 Yeah. Speaker 7 00:31:57 I think I'm gonna get, Speaker 2 00:31:58 But this isn't like q this isn't like Q3 2023, right? Speaker 6 00:32:04 It'll be be less than a year for sure. Speaker 7 00:32:07 Can we have a recording of this Elmo so we can play it to all the tech metrics users who complain that nothing's happening. Speaker 2 00:32:14 Yeah. And blaming us. Speaker 7 00:32:15 I have a picture of you scratching your head there. Cause I could then do that and overlay the whole thing Speaker 0 00:32:21 On this one. Speaker 7 00:32:22 Absolute silence over, I'm Speaker 0 00:32:24 Going this to you now that you think, uh, we're on need. This is like, I didn't hear you. This is what I'm working on, Paul. So this is all I'm working on right now. So just to show you how serious it is for Speaker 2 00:32:35 Us. Okay. All right. That's good. We, we'll stop beating you up on that. Yeah. Speaker 0 00:32:38 Thank you. Thank you. I dunno if you wanna set up more time for the, um, other, you know, topic, um, cuz we're, we're past time. Um, the other topic around like sales and revenue and stuff, or, or do, Amy, what do you think? Do you think you can show something in like one minute or should we reset it some more time? Speaker 6 00:33:01 Um, I, it'll probably take like 10 minutes if you, if anybody has 10 minutes just to quickly go, Speaker 2 00:33:07 We've got 10 minutes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I have Speaker 6 00:33:11 That right. So let me just share my screen really quick. All right. Can y'all see my screen? Speaker 2 00:33:29 Yep. Speaker 6 00:33:30 Okay. All right. So here's the end of day report for today. It says there's one posted ro with no sales in it, so we'll just ignore that one. Um, but I'm just gonna create a repair order really quick with a discount. Um, and then we'll take a look at how it gets reflected in end of day. And I just wanna know like which parts, uh, are not, are you guys think is, is not correct. So let me create a repair for myself. Um, and I'll just add one labor line for let's say a hundred dollars. Okay? So now see Speaker 2 00:34:16 If you were on our counter, I'd be mad at you. You already discounted Speaker 6 00:34:21 Did I <laugh>? Speaker 2 00:34:22 Yes. Speaker 6 00:34:25 Whereas, Yeah, Speaker 2 00:34:27 Well, it came up as 150 and you changed it to a hundred. Speaker 6 00:34:30 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Speaker 2 00:34:32 Just keep my money away, Amy. That's fine. Speaker 6 00:34:37 Okay, so let's say I just added discount on labor for 10%. So the sale amount for this ticket is 90 and that's like the number, that's the, the number we all wanna see, right? In terms of tax calculations. So let, let's just put a tax rate of 10% and so the taxes, oops, um, should be $9, That's all correct, right? Correct. $9 reverses. Uh, $10. Okay. So now how I expect this to show up on the end of day report for net sales should be $90, correct? Cause it's the hundred minus or $10 discount, Speaker 2 00:35:30 Right? We don't wanna pay taxes on taxes, right? Yeah. So you're saying $90, is that what it was? Speaker 6 00:35:36 Yeah, so the original, uh, labor line is a hundred, but you get a $10 discount. So the sub total is 90? Speaker 7 00:35:44 Yeah. Nine zero. I thought you said 99 9 0. Speaker 6 00:35:46 Yep. Okay. Oh, so I I also put a 10% labor tax on this. So the taxes is $9, is that correct? Speaker 7 00:35:55 Yeah. So, so your gross sales will be the $99, but you pay the $9 of that is owed to the sales tax comp, the government, you know, the state mm-hmm. <affirmative>, not us. So our, our what we pay franchise fees on will be the $90, not the 99. Speaker 6 00:36:15 Yep. Okay. So the $90 is what you wanna see for revenue in your reporting, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I'll just approve this, Speaker 7 00:36:26 Amy. That also comes back to when we are paying tax mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we're not paying them on the sales tax. Speaker 6 00:36:32 Yep. It's just, Speaker 7 00:36:33 And we're not paying them on the discount either, Speaker 6 00:36:36 Right? It's just on the subtotal, right? The $90 subtotal, Speaker 2 00:36:39 Correct. Yep. Yep, that's correct. Speaker 6 00:36:41 Okay. So I'll just close this out so it'll post my end of day. Okay. So now here when I see my subtotal, it's $90 and that's what you guys expect, right? And then also in my net sales on end of day, it's all $90. Speaker 2 00:37:03 Yes, That's, there you go. That's, that's correct. Speaker 6 00:37:05 Okay. So this is correct. Speaker 2 00:37:07 Yeah. So if we scroll down right now, if we scroll down a little more through payments Speaker 6 00:37:11 Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Speaker 2 00:37:13 Okay, good. Speaker 6 00:37:14 Yeah. So the payments is the $99 that I took from the customer. Speaker 2 00:37:19 Yep. Speaker 6 00:37:20 Okay, great. And then for all of these top line numbers, okay, it says I have two, two, ros, it's calculating the average like the aros based on the subtotal. So 90 divided by 2 45 mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Um, and then, so my question is for refunds, Um, do you guys wanna see that as separate? Like we could incorporate it as part of like revenue for each of these lines? So for instance, if I, if there was an additional $10 refund on labor, it could show $80 here, or do you guys wanna see refunds like separated out? Speaker 2 00:38:09 So Paul, you can disagree with me or not, but I, so I think if, if it's calculating correctly, like it looks like it is here, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, then maybe just, you know, on the RO summary, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> sales, sales fees, refunds, discounts. I think if we could see it over there, because then we just, we really from a, from a 30,000 foot view, right? We just need, you know, if, if a store had, you know, $5,000 in refunds once one day, that's our flag, right? Whoa. What the heck happened there, right? Yeah. Um, and everything that happens to the left and below that RO summary box, I mean, to the right of that summary box and below it is if, if all that's calculating correctly, we probably don't need to see it broken out over there. Would you agree, Paul? Speaker 7 00:38:53 Yeah, I think, I think what we're looking at, um, Greg, is this, if you look at this $90 sale, let's say for instance we had $20 refund from a previous day, we still want to see today's sales at $90. Okay? The refund, I think, and Greg again, shut me down the refund really comes up, up under the payments, doesn't it? Because Speaker 2 00:39:22 That's that. So yeah, I think we might be saying the thing, same thing, I'm just looking at putting that over in the I summary box mm-hmm. <affirmative>, right? So like here we see we had sales of a hundred dollars today, and if we were to do a refund, let's say it was $20, that would be below, and then our sub total would be, right, a hundred dollars in sales, $10 in discounts, and $10 in refunds, let's say then our subtotal would be $80, correct? Speaker 7 00:39:48 Under, under the payments box, right? Speaker 2 00:39:50 Under and the RO summary. Yeah. Speaker 6 00:39:53 It'll show up in both the, the payments capturing like your actual taking the money back or Speaker 2 00:40:00 Giving money in your money in hand, right? Yes. Speaker 6 00:40:03 And then this is just tracking the reduction in revenue. Speaker 7 00:40:07 But that, but that's what I'm saying, Greg, that ro summary, that little box that is highlighted, that's the day's sales. Now, unless that refund is reflected in today. So in other words, if you had to refund money from, let's just say today is Friday, okay? You have to refund Mrs. Jones from a Monday purchase. Speaker 2 00:40:30 Mm-hmm. Speaker 7 00:40:30 <affirmative>, you're not gonna show it in today's sales, are you? Speaker 2 00:40:33 No. So today's so, so the way, and you guys correct me if I'm wrong, right? But that refund is its own separate transaction. Its own separate invoice, right? Yep. Speaker 7 00:40:44 That's Speaker 2 00:40:44 Fine. But let's say we did, let's say we did, you know, a hundred dollars in sales today, right? We had, we had 10 invoices that were all for our, for $10 and we did a hundred dollars in sales and we had one refund invoice that was $20. We've got 11 invoices and we've got $80 in sales, correct? After, right? So sales was a hundred right? Below that is refunds for 20, right? And that gets us to a sub total of 80. Does that make sense? Speaker 6 00:41:15 Yes. Yeah. Speaker 2 00:41:16 Okay. Yeah. Sense to you. Speaker 6 00:41:26 Yeah. And that's kind of the big thing that we're changing is the ability to post that reduction in sales to a a different day. That's not the original, Speaker 2 00:41:38 Right? That is a cruel accounting. Accounting, Right? <laugh> updated the cool, Perfect. No, I think it sounds like we're on the right track. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Speaker 6 00:41:53 Awesome. Yeah. And that's, that's the last thing I wanted to go over. Um, well, Speaker 0 00:42:00 All right then. Sounds good. Um, thanks. Thanks everyone. Um, we'll keep you posted on progress.
